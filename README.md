# CSV-to-SQL
WebScript to Import CSV files to SQL DB with some columns rules.<br>
<br>
I guys this webscript allows you to easly upload a .csv file with "," or ";" to SQL DB.<br>
Sounds silly, but this webscript actually save alot of time.<br>
<br>
For an extra protection I implated .htaccess with password.<br>
Use https://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/ to generate new users and passwords.<br>
After that you might copy that to /global/.htpasswd. Check if .htaccess have the correct link to .htpasswd<br>
